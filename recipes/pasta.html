        <li>Half cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>A quarter cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Add penne and cook, stirring occasionaly, until tender 
            yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter and vegetable oil large 
            oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook until 
            fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shrimp, 2 tablespoons parsley, and 
            dill. Cook and stir, flipping shrimp halfway, until pink, 
            3 to 4 minutes. Move shrimp to a plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Melt the remaining 2 tablespoon butter in the skillet, 
                stirring into the shrimp juices. Add flour; whisk until fully
                combined and starting to turn golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
                Add chicken broth and milk in that order; whisk to combine.
                stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Bring sauce to simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and Romano cheese into the sauce until cheeses begin to melt 
            and sauce is creamy. Add 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese. Mix in about 1/2 the cooked 
            penne to start; add more if there is enough sauce to coat. 
            Add the shrimp and stir to combine. Top with the remaining parsley, Parmesan, and mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven and bake until top is golden and sauce
            bubbles around the edges of the skillet, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>If the top of the dish is not a nice golden color after baking,
        you can broil it, watching closely, until top is golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
